# My FastAPI Project

This project is a FastAPI-based application that allows users to upload CSV files containing company information. The application then uses a language model (LLM) to classify whether each company is a technology company based on its description. The results are stored in a PostgreSQL database.

## Features

- **CSV Upload:** Accepts a user-uploaded CSV file containing company records.
- **Dynamic Column Detection:** Automatically detects columns from the uploaded CSV file.
- **LLM Integration:** Classifies companies as technology companies using a language model.
- **Database Integration:** Stores the results in a PostgreSQL database.
